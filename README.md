This project deploys a 3-tier application consisting of a frontend, backend, and database on a cloud-based Kubernetes service. The infrastructure is defined as code using automation tools for cloud resource management, allowing easy scaling and management of resources. The application components are containerized to ensure consistency across environments, while continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines streamline the processes of building and deploying the application. 
This approach ensures efficient application delivery, scalability, and management in a cloud-native environment
